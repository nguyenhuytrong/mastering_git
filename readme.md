## Hello, Git!

### Install Posh-Git
To keep track of what is the 'head' is currently on. I mean when use the 'checkout'.
and it's shown in the terminal

Steps:
```powershell
Install-Module posh-git -Scope CurrentUser
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
Import-Module posh-git
Add-PoshGitToProfile
. $PROFILE
```

### Branch
I'm currently working with the feature-branch.
It's absolutely fun and helpful. I'm going to learn
how to cooperate with others using Git & GitHub.

### I love Git & GitHub
